In the series of **Big Ban Theory**, there is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.

As Sheldon explains, **"Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."**

In the program, you can play the traditional one (rock-paper-scissors), or you can try the Big Bang one (rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)! Having fun!
